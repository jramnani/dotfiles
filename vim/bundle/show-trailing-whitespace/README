DESCRIPTION
This plugin highlights whitespace at the end of each line (except when typing
at the end of a line). It uses the matchadd()-function, therefore doesn't
interfere with syntax highlighting and leaves the :match command for other
uses.
Highlighting can be switched on/off globally and for individual buffers. The
plugin comes with exceptions for certain filetypes, where certain lines can /
must include trailing whitespace; additional patterns can be configured.

RELATED WORKS
There are already a number of plugins for this purpose, most based on this
VimTip:

However, most of them use the older :match command and are not as flexible.
- smartmatcheol.vim (vimscript #2635) highlights based on file extension or
  name.
- trailing-whitespace (vimscript #3201) uses :match.
- bad-whitespace (vimscript #3735) uses :match, allows on/off/toggling via
  commands.
- Trailer Trash (vimscript #3938) uses :match.
- DynamicSigns (vimscript #3965) can show whitespace errors (also mixed
  indent) in the sign column.

Many plugins also come with a command to strip off the trailing whitespace;
this plugin separates this into the companion DeleteTrailingWhitespace.vim
plugin (vimscript #3967), which can even remove the trailing whitespace
automatically on each write.

To quickly locate the occurrences of trailing whitespace, you can use the
companion JumpToTrailingWhitespace.vim plugin (vimscript #3968).

USAGE
By default, trailing whitespace is highlighted in all Vim buffers. Some users
may want to selectively enable / disable this for certain filetypes, or files
in a particular directory hierarchy, or toggle this on demand. Since it's
difficult to accommodate all these demands with short and easy mappings and
commands, this plugin does not define any of them, and leaves it to you to
tailor the plugin to your needs. See ShowTrailingWhitespace-configuration
below.
